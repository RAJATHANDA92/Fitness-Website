                    <h1><b>Best Triceps Exercise</b></h1><br><br>

                    <h3><b>Skullcrusher:</b> </h3><br>
                    <img src="/img/Triceps.jpg" class="barbell-bench" alt="barbell-bench-press">
                    <p><b> Why it's on the list:</b>This move—also known as a lying triceps extension—hammers two of the three heads of the triceps: the long and lateral heads. The most popular version is performed on a flat bench with the elbows locked over the head (hence the name), but it's also great on a decline or incline bench. It also works with a wide variety of resistance including not only an EZ-bar, but also dumbbells, cables, or even the Smith machine. The article, "Your Complete Guide to Skullcrushers" gives plenty of options to choose from.</p>
                    
                    
                    <h3><b>Close-Grip Bench Press:</b></h3> <br>
                    <img src="/img/Tricpes/close-grip.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                    <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b> If you've read our 10 Best Exercises guides for chest, back, or shoulders, then you already know that we favor compound (multijoint) exercises. Why? Because they're the best for progressive overload and muscle growth. Even though the bench press is usually a chest exercise, a close-grip press has been shown to hit the triceps harder than wider grips, particularly when performed for heavier sets.
                        <br><br>
                    
                        To really torch the back of your arms, use a close grip, but keep your hands around 8-10 inches apart. Tuck your arms in to decrease the amount of stress on your pecs and shoulders while increasing the demand on your triceps.</p>

                        <h3><b>Triceps Dip:</b></h3> <br>
                        <img src="/img/Tricpes/triceps-dip-header-830x467.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                        <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b> Dips are a proven mass-builder on their own. Their only problem: Lots of people can't do enough reps to get within the ideal muscle-building rep range of 8-12 reps. Either that, or they can do way too many. In the former case, use the assisted dip/pull-up machine or a band. In the latter, add weight with a dip belt or a light dumbbell between your knees or feet.
                            <br><br>
                            Dips hit both the chest and triceps, but to favor the tris, keep your body as vertical as possible. Don't lean forward and keep those elbows tight to your sides. Think dips won't work for you? Take a look at any male gymnast; horseshoe triceps come standard issue with all those dips!</p>
                            <br><br>

                            <h3><b>Bench Dip :<b></h3>
                            <br>
                        <img src="/img/Tricpes/bench-dip-header-830x467.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                        <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b> Another dip? Yep. EMG evidence suggests that there's substantial triceps activation during a bench dip. How can you make this classic calisthenics move even better? By bumping up the load with added weight!
                            <br><br>
                            The best and safest way to load up is to have a partner place weights across your lap. Intensity boosters like dropsets are easy to do: just remove a plate to extend your set.
                           </p><br><br>

                           <h3><b>Triceps Machine Dip :</b></h3>
                            <br>
                        <img src="/img/Tricpes/triceps-dip-machine-header-830x467.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                        <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b>This compound exercise makes it especially easy to pick and change weights for different rep ranges. This makes it easy to do forced reps, dropsets, or even rest-pause sets to boost your intensity.
                            <br><br>
                            Pro tip: Many trainees mess up here by failing to go to full triceps extension and stopping short of fully bending their elbows. Your triceps are elbow extenders, so perform the full range of motion.
                           </p> <br><br>

                           <h3><b>Board Press :</b></h3>
                           <br>
                       <img src="/img/Tricpes/board-press-header-830x467.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                       <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b> Take a look at the bench press and you'll notice that the last two-thirds of the movement is mostly elbow extension—in other words, triceps. This is one reason why super strong pressers prioritize triceps training and love the board press to do it.
                        <br><br>
                        The board press is a partial-rep version of the bench press where you place 2x4s on your chest to preferentially train the lockout. Don't have boards? An easier gym hack may be simply to move a bench inside the rack and set the pins a few inches off your chest.
                          </p> <br>

                          <h3><b> Dumbbell Overhead Triceps Extension : </b></h3>
                          <br>
                      <img src="/img/Tricpes/cable-overhead-triceps-ext-header-830x467.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                      <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b>Once your arms go overhead, the long head of the triceps gets prioritized. This head is difficult to target otherwise, which is why it's always a good idea to include some kind of overhead exercise in your triceps workout.
                        <br>
                        Luckily, you have options! You can go one arm or two, seated or standing, and if you have a partner, you can go heavy and do some forced reps.
                         </p> <br>

                         <h3><b>Cable Overhead Extension With Rope :</b></h3>
                         <br>
                     <img src="/img/Tricpes/cable-overhead-triceps-ext-header-830x467.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                     <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b>Like dumbbell overhead work, cable overhead presses focus on the often underdeveloped long head. The constant tension provided by the cable might actually make this a better choice than dumbbells if you're picking between the two.
                        </p> <br>
