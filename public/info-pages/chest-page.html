                    <h1><b>Best Chest Exercise</b></h1><br><br>
                    <h3><b>Barbell Bench Press :</b> </h3><br>
                    <img src="/img/chest/barbell-bench-press.jpg" class="barbell-bench" alt="barbell-bench-press">
                    <p><b> Why it's on the list:</b> It's popular to hate on the bench press these days, but it's one of the most popular lifts in the gym for a reason. <br> For one, the standard barbell bench allows you to move the most weight. It's also an easier lift to control than pressing with heavy dumbbells. <br> The exercise is also relatively easy to spotâ€”so don't be afraid to ask for one!

                        The bench press also responds well to classic protocols like 5x5 for muscle and strength, or even 10x10, aka German Volume Training, for pure mass. If you want to get serious, there are systematic bench press programs like Bench 300 to help you chase a big number.</p>
                    <p><b> In your workout:</b> Bench toward the start of your chest workout for heavy sets in lower rep ranges, such as 5-8 reps.<br>There are better moves for high-rep chest burnouts. Vary your grip width and style for more complete chest development.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Dumbell Bench Press :</h3> <br>
                    <img src="/img/chest/dumbbell-bench-press.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                    <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b> Whether dumbbell or barbell presses are better for growth is an age-old weight-room debate. <br> Luckily, you can do both! But there's little doubt that the dumbbell variation  has more versatility throughout the beginning, middle,<br> and end of a chest workout.
                    
                        Some other big plusses for dumbbells: Each side's musculature must work independently, creating more balanced strength and size.<br> Dumbbells also allow a longer range of motion, which some studies say can lead to muscle growth. <br> Plus, you can more easily tweak your grip to create variety and a new stimulus on chest day.</p>

                        <h3><b>Inclined Bench Press</b></h3> <br>
                        <img src="/img/chest/incline-bench-press.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                        <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b>  Not only is the incline bench press a classic way to build the upper chest, many lifters find them to be a more comfortable "main lift" for the shoulders than flat benching. It's great with a barbell or multi-grip bar, but maybe be even better with dumbbells, since you can customize your grip to increase focus on the upper pecs. <br><br>

                            Pro tip: Many benches are fixed at a very steep angle, which EMG results have shown works the front delts as much as the chest. If possible, go for a lower incline, such as 30 degrees, to focus squarely on the upper pecs.
                            <br><br>
                            Want to dial it in further? The same study suggests that bringing your grip in a bit closer helps to hammer the upper chest fibers significantly more.</p>

                            <h3><b>Declined Bench Press :</b></h3>
                            <br>
                        <img src="/img/chest/machine-chest-press.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                        <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b> Free-weight pressing moves on a flat bench are great, but machine press and cable press variations have some unique benefits. For one, it's easier to slow down the repetition, both in the concentric and eccentric phases. Stack-loaded machines are also great for quickly doing dropsets. <br><br>

                            Feel like a step down from free weights? It shouldn't. EMG research demonstrates that the machine bench press recruits the shoulders far less than free-weight variations. This allows you to really target your pecs.

                           <h3><b>Push Up :</b></h3>
                            <br>
                        <img src="/img/chest/push-up.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                        <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b> An obvious point in favor of push-ups is that they require no equipment and can be the centerpiece of a home chest workout, like in strength coach Paul Carter's program Jacked at Home: Bodyweight Muscle-Building Workouts. But they're also highly versatile, easy to adjust for range of motion, and can help strategically target different parts of your chest with a few simple tweaks to elevation or hand placement.<br><br>

                            "Yeah, but they're just push-ups," you say. "They're definitely not enough to make you strong." Believe it or not, an in-depth analysis found that push-ups and bench presses are similar in both muscle activation and overall muscle gains. This doesn't mean push-ups should be all you do, but it means they definitely should have a place in your repertoire.
                           </p> <br><br>

                       <img src="/img/chest/machine-fly.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                       <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b> For the majority of lifters, the machine chest fly (aka, pec-deck) is a more effective, harder-to-screw-up alternative to dumbbell flyes. If your gym has one, it's a great move to get a great pump without having to balance any weights or put your shoulders at risk.<br><br>

                        But does it work? EMG data shows that activation of the pectoralis major is statistically similar between the machine fly and bench press, which means that even though you'll likely be working in different rep ranges for each exercise, both are worthy components to chest day. The big difference? For the machine, you don't need a spotter and can more safely push the intensity and reach true muscle failure.
