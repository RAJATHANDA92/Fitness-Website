                    <h1><b>Best Shoulders Exercise</b></h1><br><br>
                    <h3><b>Barbell-Push-Press:</b> </h3><br>
                    <img src="/img/shoulder/barbell-push-press.jpg" class="barbell-bench" alt="barbell-bench-press">
                    <p><b> Why it's on the list:</b>This mighty pull is far more than a back exercise. It hits the entire posterior chain, from your calves to your upper traps, but it's also a time-tested standout for overall backside development.
                    <br>
                        And no, it's not just for powerlifters! Legendary bodybuilder Jay Cutler builds his back day around deadlifts, as well. Technique is uber-important, but once you nail it, you can progress to lifting monster weights that recruit maximum muscle, release muscle-building hormones, and help you get big..</p>
                    
                    
                    <h3>Military Press:</h3> <br>
                    <img src="/img/Back/bent-over-row.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                    <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b>Like the push-press, this is a challenging full-body lift. It was once contested as a powerlift, and with a barbell, remains a popular lift for setting ambitious strength goals. But research has shown that dumbbells elicit a greater degree of muscle activation, even if you can't lift quite as much total weight.
                        <br><br>
                        Pro tip: Be sure to maintain a neutral hip position and learn how to brace your core to protect your lumbar spine. If you spend all of your time injured, you'll miss out on the gains!</p>

                        <h3><b>Rear Delt Press</b></h3> <br>
                        <img src="/img/Back/pull-up.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                        <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b>  What the heck is a row doing in an article about shoulder exercises? Remember, rowing movements don't just work the "back," they involve the rear delts to a significant degree, as well. And experts like physical therapist John Rusin, creator of the BodyFit resource Unstoppable: The Ultimate Guide to Training Through Injury, believe that a key to shoulder health is rowing twice or even three times as much as you press.
<br><br>
                            One more point in favor of rows, particularly on an incline bench: a 2014 study found that in addition to hitting the rear delts as well as flyes, they activated the middle delt significantly better than dumbbell shoulder presses, cable lateral raises, and even barbell upright rows. This makes it a no-brainer for creating a time-efficient shoulder workout.</p>

                            <h3><b>Seated Dumbell Press<b></h3>
                            <br>
                        <img src="/img/Back/t-bar-row.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                        <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b> Swapping out the barbell for dumbbells on overhead presses works each side independently, which is great for balanced development. The range of motion is also a bit longer, which can help maximize muscle growth. Pressing in a seated position also removes the lower body, allowing you to focus squarely on the shoulders.
                           </p> <br><br>

                           <h3><b>Seated Barbell Press:</b></h3>
                            <br>
                        <img src="/img/Back/seated-row.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                        <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b>Using a barbell rather than dumbbells may seem like a matter of taste, but there are functional reasons to pick the big bar. For one, you can put a bench in a rack and press off of the safety pins, allowing you to dial in your desired range of motion. Doing barbell-style presses on a Smith machine also allows you to safely push a bit closer to failure than other press variations and really focus on performing slow negatives.
                           </p> <br><br>

                           <h3><b>Upright Row</b></h3>
                           <br>
                       <img src="/img/Back/smith-machine-row.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                       <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b>Upright rows have a reputation as a shoulder destroyer, but like anything, it's all about how you perform them. As personal trainer Jimmy Peña explains in the article, "How Wide Should My Grip Be on an Upright Row," don't take a close grip, which can internally rotate your shoulders. Instead, take a wider grip where your upper arms go directly out to your sides.
<br><br>
                        The science backs this up, too. A wider grip has been demonstrated to both significantly increase delt activation and also minimizing the biceps' role in the movement. You can also perform these one arm at a time to get the same effect.
                          </p> <br>

                          <h3><b>Arnold Press</b></h3>
                          <br>
                      <img src="/img/Back/lat-pull-down.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                      <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b>Yes, this is just a dumbbell press with some rotation added in. Why give it a separate callout? Because the namesake of the move was definitely onto something!
<br><br>
                        Research has shown that the staple move of old-school muscle-building programs like the Blueprint to Mass hits both the front and medial delts more than other dumbbell press variations. Plus, many lifters simply find it more friendly to their shoulder joints. That's a big one-two punch.
                         </p> <br>

                         <h3><b>Lateral Raise</b></h3>
                         <br>
                     <img src="/img/Back/single-arm-dumbbell-row.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                     <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b>This is one of the most popular and best isolation exercises in the weight room, but it's tougher to master than it seems. Beginners usually benefit from two cues: lead with your elbows, and only go down until your arms are about 30 degrees out from your sides. Both will help your raises be better—and more difficult.
