                    <h1><b>Best Biceps Exercise</b></h1><br><br>

                    <h3><b>Barbell Or EZ-Bar Curl:</b> </h3><br>
                    <img src="/img/Biceps.jpg" class="barbell-bench" alt="barbell-bench-press">
                    <p><b> Why it's on the list:</b>The standard shoulder-width curl engages the short and long heads of the biceps equally, you can alter grip width to slightly change the emphasis (wide to target the short head, narrow for the long head), you can really pile on the weight, and you don't have to sit there endlessly working one arm at a time.
        <br><br>
                        How many more reasons do you need? If you're only going to do one biceps exercise, make it this one.
        <br><br>                
                        Want to use a straight bar instead of a cambered EZ-bar? Have at it, if your wrists don't mind. A 2018 study found that while both variants produced greater activity than dumbbell curls, "The small difference between [barbell] and EZ variantsâ€¦ makes the choice between these two exercises a matter of subjective comfort."</p>
                    
                    
                    <h3><b>Cable Curl:</b></h3> <br>
                    <img src="/img/Back/bent-over-row.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                    <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b>This movement seems a lot like the standing barbell curl at first glance. After all, they're both bilateral movements in which you take a shoulder-width, underhand grip on the bar. What makes it different is that, like all of the best muscle-building cable exercises, the angle of loading gives you constant tension on the muscle through the full range of motion.
                    <br><br>
                        Essentially, that means you can't rest at the bottom or the top, which creates more total time under tension. Plus, depending on the gym you're in, you might have numerous handle options and body positions to keep you busy.</p>

                        <h3><b>Dumbell Curl</b></h3> <br>
                        <img src="/img/Back/pull-up.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                        <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b> Is this really any different than a barbell curl? That's up to you. Sure, you can do the moves in basically the same way in the same workout, but we don't recommend it. The real value of dumbbell curls is that they can be done a number of ways: standing or seated, with both arms or alternating, rotating your wrists into Zottman curls to work on your fearsome forearms, or twisting that pinky up to focus purely on the bis. In short, you have options.</p>
                            <br><br>

                            <h3><b>Preacher Curl<b></h3>
                            <br>
                        <img src="/img/Back/t-bar-row.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                        <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b> There are many versions of the preacher curl, and every serious physique builder has their fave. Whatever version you do, you'll get a serious pump, particularly if you have a quality pre-workout or pump supplement coursing through your bloodstream at the time. In fact, this old-school peak-builder can be nearly enough for an entire biceps workout, perhaps with something like hammer curls added to it.
                        <br><br>
                            As with other movements that start from a stretched position, you get the most muscle activation during the lower third of the movement. As the weight moves up, the muscle doesn't have to work as hard. This is one reason the cable might be the best implement to use here to help complete your biceps.
                           </p><br><br>

                           <h3><b>Chin Ups:</b></h3>
                            <br>
                        <img src="/img/Biceps/weighted-chin-up.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                        <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b>Ever done a set of max-rep chins? Then you know the biceps are working seriously hard during this move. Both pull-ups (overhand grip) and chin-ups (underhand grip) have a high degree of elbow flexion, but research has shown that chin-ups work the biceps significantly more.
<br><br>
                            Sets of 8-12 reps too easy? Add weight. Too hard? Use assistance. Too uncomfortable on your wrists or elbows? Alternate with a neutral (palms facing in) or cambered grip, or perform them on rings. Grip giving out? Wear wrist straps.
                           </p> <br><br>

                           <h3><b>Reverse-Grip Barbell Row</b></h3>
                           <br>
                       <img src="/img/Biceps/reverse-grip_barbell_row.gif" class="barbell-bench">
                       <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b> Some lifters speak reverently of the bent-over row as the "fourth powerlift." Whether you agree or not, this is a back-focused movement in which you can go very heavy, and with the reverse grip, the biceps are heavily engaged. It's not really the kind of exercise you'd do on a biceps-only day, so it makes a good bridge between back and biceps.
                          </p> <br>

                          <h3><b>Hammer Curl</b></h3>
                          <br>
                      <img src="/img/Back/lat-pull-down.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                      <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b>Curls with a palms-facing or neutral grip do more than just hit the biceps, they also heavily recruit the brachialis, a muscle that doesn't get measured on EMG studies because it's beneath the biceps. Because it's not as obvious a move as, say, a barbell curl, it often gets undeservedly skipped on arm day.
                        <br><br>
                        Why should you care? Increasing the girth of the brachialis can "raise" your biceps from below, making your entire arm larger. Another reason: They were Chris Hemsworth's go-to curl to transform into Thor.
                        <br><br>
                        Pro tip: The dumbbell version is solid, but even better is the cable version holding a rope grip, because it gives you constant tension throughout the range of motion.
                         </p> <br>

                         <h3><b>Incline Curl</b></h3>
                         <br>
                     <img src="/img/Back/single-arm-dumbbell-row.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                     <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b>What's the difference between curling at 90 degrees and 45? More than you think. The incline curl elongates the biceps and increases the stretch at the start of the movement. Theoretically, this helps you target the long head and build the so-called "biceps peak."
