                    <h1><b>Best Back Exercise</b></h1><br><br>
                    <h3><b>Deadlift :</b> </h3><br>
                    <img src="/img/Back/Deadlift.jpg" class="barbell-bench" alt="barbell-bench-press">
                    <p><b> Why it's on the list:</b>This mighty pull is far more than a back exercise. It hits the entire posterior chain, from your calves to your upper traps, but it's also a time-tested standout for overall backside development.
                    <br>
                        And no, it's not just for powerlifters! Legendary bodybuilder Jay Cutler builds his back day around deadlifts, as well. Technique is uber-important, but once you nail it, you can progress to lifting monster weights that recruit maximum muscle, release muscle-building hormones, and help you get big..</p>
                    
                    
                    <h3>Bend Over-Row :</h3> <br>
                    <img src="/img/Back/bent-over-row.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                    <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b>This is a total back-builder: upper back, lower back, lats, traps, spinal erectors—the whole deal. And the science backs it up. It's a staple of the best back workouts for men, but make no mistake, it's great for back workouts for women, as well. <br></p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>In your workout:</b> Do heavy bent-over rows toward the start of your back workout in lower rep ranges, such as 6-8 or 8-10, in order to save your lower back. If you're wrecked from deadlifts, skip it or do it on a second back day later in the week.</p>

                        <h3><b>Pull Ups :</b></h3> <br>
                        <img src="/img/Back/pull-up.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                        <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b>   It's always a good idea to have an overhead pulling movement in your back routine, and the pull-up is one of the best. Each variation has its own advantages: Wide-grip variations are great for the upper lats, while close-grip chins or neutral-grip pull-ups have a greater stretch and overall range of motion. Mix it up! <br><br>

                            <b>In your workout:</b>  If you're a pull-up pro, you can do some light sets as a warm-up. If they're tougher for you, you can treat them more as a strength movement toward the start of your workout. Assisted variations make for great burnouts at the end of a back workout.</p>
                            <br><br>

                            <h3><b>T-bar Row :<b></h3>
                            <br>
                        <img src="/img/Back/t-bar-row.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                        <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b> The T-bar row may seem at first glance like another variation of the bent-over row, but serious lifters know there's a big difference. For one, you can pile on more weight! <br><br>

                            You also typically have a choice of hand positions and width. A wider grip will put more emphasis on the lats, while a neutral grip will better target the middle back (rhomboids, teres, and traps).
                           </p> <br><br>

                           <h3><b>Seated Row :</b></h3>
                            <br>
                        <img src="/img/Back/seated-row.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                        <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b>Unlike every free-weight variation here, the classic seated row maintains constant tension throughout every inch of the movement.
<br><br>
                            Plus, many gyms have a wide range of handles that you can clip onto a seated cable row with a carabiner, giving you all manner of wide and narrow grips and different hand positions.
                           </p> <br><br>

                           <h3><b>Single-Arm Smith Machine Row :</b></h3>
                           <br>
                       <img src="/img/Back/smith-machine-row.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                       <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b> While some gym rats consider the Smith machine taboo, you shouldn't. The fixed plane of the movement allows you to pull heavy with lots of stability, making for a humbling exercise.
<br><br>
                        Treat it like a cross between a dumbbell row and a machine row, utilizing benefits of each. The single-arm version, with the elbows pulling back close to your sides, is especially effective at targeting the lower portion of the lats
                          </p> <br>

                          <h3><b>Lat Pull Down :</b></h3>
                          <br>
                      <img src="/img/Back/lat-pull-down.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                      <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b>Your first impulse may be to reach for the wide-grip bar, but back-focused EMG research suggests that use of a close neutral grip activates the lats similarly to a regular grip. This grip also allows for a longer range of motion and increased time under tension for the lats, which is great for building muscle.
<br><br>
                        Slow down the rep tempo on these, squeeze hard at the bottom of each rep, and allow a good stretch at the top.
                         </p> <br>

                         <h3><b>Single Arm Dumbell Row :</b></h3>
                         <br>
                     <img src="/img/Back/single-arm-dumbbell-row.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                     <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b>This is a classic unilateral exercise—meaning each side works independently. It's also one that allows you to move a lot of weight, particularly if you use straps.
<br><br>
You'll get a greater range of motion when training unilaterally, and you'll be better able to support your lower back by placing one hand on a bench. Allowing a slight degree of rotation of the trunk has been shown to activate a greater amount of "core" musculature, as well.
                        </p> <br>
