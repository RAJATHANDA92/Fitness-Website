                    <h1><b>Best Legs Exercise</b></h1><br><br>

                    <h3><b>Barbell Back Squat:</b> </h3><br>
                    <img src="/img/Legs.jpg" class="barbell-bench" alt="barbell-bench-press">
                    <p><b> Why it's on the list:</b>Squats are king because they're the most challenging leg movement you can do. They work all the lower-body musculature and have been shown to spike muscle-building hormone release. In fact, squatting before doing curls has even been shown to significantly improve arm strength! Don't laugh: Powerlifter and bodybuilder Layne Norton, Ph.D., pairs the two moves in his Legs and Arms Blast workout.
                        <br><br>
                        High bar or low bar? That's up to you and your goals. High bar, where the bar rests atop the traps, hits all the leg musculature fairly evenly. Low bar, a favorite of powerlifters, targets the glutes and allows you to lift more weight. Not sure which? Choose the variation that allows you to squat deeper, more comfortably, and without excessively rounding your back.</p>
                    
                    
                    <h3><b>Barbell Front Squat:</b></h3> <br>
                    <img src="/img/Legs/BackWorkout.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                    <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b> If you've read our 10 Best Exercises guides for chest, back, or shoulders, then you already know that we favor compound (multijoint) exercises. Why? Because they're the best for progressive overload and muscle growth. Even though the bench press is usually a chest exercise, a close-grip press has been shown to hit the triceps harder than wider grips, particularly when performed for heavier sets.
                        <br><br>
                    
                        To really torch the back of your arms, use a close grip, but keep your hands around 8-10 inches apart. Tuck your arms in to decrease the amount of stress on your pecs and shoulders while increasing the demand on your triceps.</p>

                        <h3><b>Olympic Lifts: Snatch And Power Clean :</b></h3> <br>
                        <img src="/img/Legs/power-clean.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                        <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b>  Movements like snatches and power cleans take some serious dedication and technique to master, but they can be unrivaled when you are trying to improve jumping power for sports or even squat strength. In fact, one study found a nearly 18 percent greater improvement in squat 1RM after following an Olympic-based program compared to a traditional powerlifting program. 
                            <br><br>
                            While the rep ranges for these lifts aren't usually in the "golden" range for hypertrophy, the large amount of muscle mass used and higher intensities may still increase testosterone release. If you're just learning, there are plenty of progression lifts to help you get to the full lifts.
                            <br><br>
                            Dips hit both the chest and triceps, but to favor the tris, keep your body as vertical as possible. Don't lean forward and keep those elbows tight to your sides. Think dips won't work for you? Take a look at any male gymnast; horseshoe triceps come standard issue with all those dips!</p>

                            <h3><b>Deadlift :<b></h3>
                            <br>
                        <img src="/img/Legs/leg-deadlift.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                        <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b>Deadlift variations are rightfully considered whole-body exercises, specifically for the posterior chain. But research has shown that along with the hamstrings and glutes, they definitely hit the quads, as well—especially if you pull with a wider or sumo-style stance.
                           </p><br><br>

                           <h3><b>Split Squat :</b></h3>
                            <br>
                        <img src="/img/Legs/split-squat.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                        <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b>Done right, split squats—particularly rear-foot-elevated or "Bulgarian" split squats—are devastating to your legs. In fact, EMG evidence suggests that 4 sets using your 10-rep max with Bulgarians create similar quad activation to back squats. The same study also found similar testosterone responses between Bulgarians and back squats!
                            <br><br>
                            Nevertheless, split squats are deceptively difficult, partly because of balance and partly because you're training one side at a time. And when you raise your rear foot in a so-called Bulgarian split squat, everything gets tougher. If balance is holding you back, you can just drop your back foot, hold onto a stable object, or even perform them in the Smith machine.
                           </p> <br><br>

                           <h3><b>Hack Squat :</b></h3>
                           <br>
                       <img src="/img/Legs/hack-squat.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                       <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b> A knock against machine-based leg exercises is that the hormone boost they generate just doesn't compare to free weights. But that's not a reason not to do them! It just means do them later in your leg workout when you're already fatigued.
                        <br><br>
                        One of the primary benefits of the hack squat is that you can manipulate foot placement, which is why fitness model Julian "The Quad Guy" Smith considers them one of his signature moves for legs. A high placement allows you to descend farther, which emphasizes the glutes and hamstrings. A lower placement means the quads take up a greater percentage of the workload.
                        <br><br>
                        It's also easier to use advanced intensity techniques like forced reps and dropsets, because you can change weight quickly and aren't balancing a barbell.
                          </p> <br>

                          <h3><b> Lunge : </b></h3>
                          <br>
                      <img src="/img/Legs/lunge.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                      <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b>Like all the movements listed thus far, lunges involve hip and knee extension, which gives you the stimulus for both the thighs and glutes. Another advantage: They can be done weighted in traditional muscle-building rep ranges, with dumbbells or a barbell, or with body weight alone for higher reps.
                        <br><br>
                        How high? That's up to you—and your program. Strength and muscle-building coach Paul Carter's bodyweight program Jacked at Home starts off a workout each week with triple-digit walking lunges. You read that right. Give it a try if you want to see how thin the line between strength training and cardio can be.
                         </p> <br>

                         <h3><b>Leg Press :</b></h3>
                         <br>
                     <img src="/img/Legs/leg-press.jpg" class="barbell-bench">
                     <p><b>Why it's on the list:</b>Leg press vs. squat is a classic weight-room debate, but one that misses the point. Strength coach and physical therapist John Rusin explains why in his article, "Don't Do High-Rep Squats, Deads, and Bench! Do These Instead." Squats are for doing early in a leg workout and going heavy, he explains, and leg presses are for doing afterward for high reps. Sounds like a recipe for leg growth to us!
                        <br><br>
                        Like hack squats, the leg press allows for a variety of foot positions to target the outer quads, inner quads, glutes, or hamstrings. Just be careful not to lower the sled too far! This common mistake will lift your glutes up off the butt pad and cause your lower spine to curl. A rounded back puts you at risk for an injury.
